PTools-SDF-DB version 0.01
==========================

This is an add-on package for the PTools-SDF distribution.
It includes OO classes that provide a simplistic DBMS. It
provides a 'schema' language and a 'dbutil' utility script 
to add/query,etc. local and remote SDF data files.

'Schema' allows for adding data loader(s) via custom Perl 
modules (such as to obtain default data from an LDAP server).

Includes a completely transparent RPC client and server API.
Your scripts can convert from local to remote access without
any change.

See the 'Overview.pod' document included along with the
PTools-SDF distribution.
